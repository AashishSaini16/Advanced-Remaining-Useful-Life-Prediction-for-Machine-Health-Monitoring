# Advanced-Remaining-Useful-Life-Prediction-for-Machine-Health-Monitoring
This project develops a predictive maintenance system to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial machines using sensor data from the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including XGBoost, RandomForest, LightGBM, and a stacking ensemble.
